Vorpal The Hexapod (Walking And Dancing Robot)\
This cute little robot can dance and make your day by just hopping around and do some dabs, samba walks and tango invitations. I am a dancer, so whuy wouldn't have I chosen this little creature?\
It consists of a body and 6 legs with which one can play and tell the robot how to move. It also has a movable pair of eyes. Inside of it, an electronics caddy is the support for all the electronics behind the curtains:)\
This repo contains an f3d of the project and also a render photo.\
This has all been done in Fusion 360.\
Gareth Branwym is the original author of this amazing Hexapod.
