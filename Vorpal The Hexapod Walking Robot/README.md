Vorpal The Hexapod (Walking And Dancing Robot)\
\
\
This cute little robot can dance and make your day by just hopping around and do some dabs, samba walks and tango invitations. I am a dancer, so why wouldn't have I chosen this little creature?\
\
It consists of a body and 6 legs with which one can play and tell the robot how to move. It also has a movable pair of eyes. Inside of it, an electronics caddy is the support for all the electronics behind the curtains:)\
\
Four motion studies are directly available to play. While playing them, one can see the hexapod doing a belly dance, a dab, waving "Hello" to someone or watch it perform a Samba Whisk.\
\
This repository contains an f3d of the project and also a render photo. Also, there is a corresponding .stl file for all to-be-printed components: the 6 legs, 12 hinges, one main body, the electronics caddy and its corresponding caddy bars, the head and its eyes that can be placed wherever one wants (there are 6 magnets implemented on the head).\
\
This has all been done in Fusion 360.\
